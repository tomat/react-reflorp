React Reflorp
=========================

Basically a simple ORM using [react-refetch](https://github.com/heroku/react-refetch), but the data is stored in [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux).

# Example project and demo

An example project can be found [here](https://github.com/tomat/reflorp), and the latest build of it should be live at http://reflorp.com

# Installation

Requires **React 0.14 or later** and [react-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux).

```
npm install --save react-reflorp
```

This assumes that youâ€™re using [npm](http://npmjs.com/) package manager with a module bundler like [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io) or [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) to consume [CommonJS modules](http://webpack.github.io/docs/commonjs.html).

# Setup

In the following example code we have a simple app with boards and notes. Each board has a number of notes.

We currently only support two level of entities, and an entity can not have multiple parents.

Boards have a single text field: `title`.

Notes also have a single text field: `summary`.

First, add the `Container` with a configuration object as a child of the react-redux `Provider`:

```javascript
// app.js

import { Container as ReflorpContainer } from 'react-reflorp';

[...]

const configuration = {
  entities: {
    board: {
      plural: 'boards',
    },
    note: {
      parent: 'board',
      plural: 'notes',
    },
  },
  baseUrl: '/api', // is prepended to all URL:s
};

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <ReflorpContainer configuration={configuration}>
      <App />
    </ReflorpContainer>
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('app')
);
```

Then, add the reducer:

```javascript
// reducers.js

import { reducer as reflorp } from 'react-reflorp';

export default {
  reflorp,
};
```

# Backend

Currently URL:s for fetching things from the backend are automatically generated, and the basic structure can not be
changed.

URL:s and methods are based on the names of the entities and the kind of request we're doing.

## Single endpoints

Single board with id 1: `/board/1`

Single note with id 2 belonging to board with id 1: `/board/1/notes/2`

When `PATCH`:ing or `GET`:ing, single-endpoints should always return only the object requested.

Deleting an entity results in a `DELETE` to the single-endpoint.

## List endpoints

List of boards, and used for creating new boards: `/boards`

List of notes belonging to board with id 1, and used for creating new notes on that board: `/board/1/notes`

Creating a new entity results in a `POST` to the corresponding list collection (creating a new board will `POST` to
`/boards`), that should return the created object only.

### Pagination

There is built-in rudimentary support for pagination, if you call `EntityListState#more()` a new `GET` will be sent to
the same endpoint but with `?page=2`, and the result is appended to the end of the list. The page number is incremented
until it receives an empty response.

If an empty page has been received the `EntityListState#hasMore` property is set to `false`.

# Frontend

The `@reflorp` decorator corresponds to the `@connect` decorator from react-refetch.

It takes a function mapping `props` and `context` to entities.

By default it just injects the available data from the redux store. With `load: true` it will actually go fetch the
data from the backend, and keep the component informed about that process.
 
The actual data and metadata is enclosed inside the `EntityState` and `EntityListState` abstractions, which are
described further down.

## Loading and displaying

```javascript
// Board.js

import React, { PropTypes, Component } from 'react';
import { reflorp, EntityState, EntityListState } from 'react-reflorp';

@reflorp(({ id }) => ({
  board: { id, load: true },           // fetch the board data: GET /api/boards/${id}
  notes: { parentId: id, load: true }, // fetch the notes belonging to this board: GET /api/boards/${id}/notes
}))
export default class Board extends Component {
  static propTypes = {
    board: PropTypes.instanceOf(EntityState),
    notes: PropTypes.instanceOf(EntityListState),
  };

  render() {
    const { notes, board } = this.props;

    if (notes.pending || board.pending) {
      return <div>Loading...</div>;
    }

    return (
      <div>
        <h1>{board.value.title}</h1>
        <ul>
          {notes.value.map((note) => (
            <li>{note.summary}</li>
          ))}
        </ul>
        {notes.hasMore && (
          <button onClick={notes.more}>Load more notes...</button>
        )}
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

## Creating

```javascript
// CreateBoard.js

import React, { PropTypes, Component } from 'react';
import { reflorp, EntityState } from 'react-reflorp';

@reflorp(() => ({
  board: {
    create: true,
    onCreate: (board) => {
      const boardId = board.value.id;
      // Here you may for example redirect to the view board page
    },
  },
}))
export default class CreateBoard extends Component {
  static propTypes = {
    board: PropTypes.instanceOf(EntityState),
  };

  render() {
    const { board } = this.props;

    return (
      <form>
        <input onChange={board.handleChange} type="text" name="title" placeholder="Title" />
        <button disabled={board.loading} onClick={board.save}>Create new board</button>
        {board.rejected && board.error}
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```

## Editing and deleting

```javascript
// EditNote.js

import React, { PropTypes, Component } from 'react';
import { reflorp, EntityState } from 'react-reflorp';

@reflorp(({ noteId, boardId }) => ({
  note: {
    id: noteId,
    parentId: boardId,
    load: true,
    onDel: () => {
      // Callback for when the note has been deleted
      // Here you may for example redirect back to another view
    },
  },
}))
export default class EditNote extends Component {
  static propTypes = {
    note: PropTypes.instanceOf(EntityState),
  };

  render() {
    const { note } = this.props;
    
    if (note.pending) {
      return <div>Loading...</div>;
    }

    return (
      <form>
        <input
          defaultValue={note.value.summary}
          onChange={note.handleChange}
          type="text"
          name="summary"
          placeholder="Summary"
        />
        <button disabled={note.loading} onClick={note.save}>Save note</button>
        <button disabled={note.loading} onClick={note.del}>Delete note</button>
        {note.draft.rejected && note.draft.reason}
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```

# API

## State objects

The state objects `EntityState` and `EntityListState` are the link between your component and react-reflorp. They
contain data and metadata about either a single entity, or a list of entities.

We use the excellent `PromiseState` class from react-refetch, which is fully documented
[over here](https://github.com/heroku/react-refetch/blob/master/docs/api.md#promisestate).

Both state objects below have these properties of the `data` PromiseState available for easier access:
- `value` - `array|object`: the actual data as received from the server
- `pending` - `bool`: true if the data is being fetched for the first time (`value` is null)
- `refreshing` - `bool`: true if the data is being updated in some way (`value` is present but may soon be outdated)
- `fulfilled` - `bool`: true if the latest request was successful
- `rejected` - `bool`: true if the latest request was unsuccessful
  - Usually a rejected `PromiseState` does not have a value, but here we actually keep the latest value accessible, even
  if it may be out of date depending of the kind of error occurred
- `settled` - `bool`: true if the latest request has been completed, regardless of whether it was a success or not

### EntityState

A synchronous representation of a single entity and its metadata, with helper functions for dispatching common actions
to redux.

It has the following properties:
- `data` - `PromiseState`: describes the state of the data for this entity
- `draft` - `PromiseState`: describes the state of the draft for this entity
- `entity` - `string`: the name of the entity type (i e `board`)
- `id` - `string`: the id of the entity (i e `1`)
- `parentId` - `string`: the id of the parent of the entity (i e `2`)
- `loading` - `bool`: true if either `data.pending` or `data.refreshing` is true

And the following functions:
- `save(thenCallback, catchCallback)`: sends what is currently in the draft as a `PATCH` or `POST` (depending on if
we're in edit or create mode) to the backend
- `edit(draft)`: updates the current draft for this entity (is merged shallowly with the previous draft)
- `del(thenCallback, catchCallback)`: sends a `DELETE` to the backend
  - If this request is successful the entity will be removed entirely from the store
- `reset()`: resets the draft to the latest data fetched from the backend

### EntityListState

A synchronous representation of a list of entities and its metadata, with helper functions for dispatching common
actions to redux.

It has the following properties:
- `data` - `PromiseState`: describes the state of the data
- `entity` - `string`: the name of the entity type (i e `board`)
- `parentId` - `string`: the id of the parent of these entities (i e `2`)
- `loading` - `bool`: true if either `data.pending` or `data.refreshing` is true
- `hasMore` - `bool`: true if the next page of this list is probably not empty

And the following functions:
- `more()`: fetches additional data from the backend, see the Pagination section further up
